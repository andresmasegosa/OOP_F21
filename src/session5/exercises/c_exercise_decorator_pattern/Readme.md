In this exercise, you have a class *FileDataHandler* which
simulates the writing of some *String* object to a file. You 
are also given two classes that simulates the compression and 
the encryption of a *String* object. 


Try to refactor these classes using the **Decorator design 
pattern** to have the possibility of compressing and enrypting
a *String* object before is written to a file. Use the provided
classes *DataCompressor* and *DataEncryptor* to simulate the
compression and the encryption of a *String* object.
